# CS774 team project

## Schedule
- Week  5 (09/28): **Introduction, Team matching**
- Week  8 (10/19, 10/22): **Project proposal, Peer grading**
  - Proposal submission deadline: **(TBA)**
  - Peer grading: **(TBA)**
- Week 12 (11/16, 11/18): **Progress Update, Peer grading**
  - Progress submission deadline: **(TBA)**
  - Peer grading: **(TBA)**
- Week 16 (12/14, 12/16): **Final presentation, Final report, Peer grading, Teamwork report**

## Goal
This project aims to replicate an existing paper and then make meaningful improvements/extensions in terms of machine learning model, features, datasets, evaluation metrics or baseline comparisons.

## Teams
This is a team-based project. Please form teams of **1-2 students** by **28 Sep**. If you need help forming teams, advertise yourself and find your teammate in **KLMS # proj-team-matching**.

## Project Grading (50% of Course Grade)
- **Proposal presentation**: 5%
- **Progress presentation**: 5%
- **Final presentation**: 15%
- **Final report**: 10%
- **Peer grading**: 10%
- **Teamwork report**: 5%

**Note that any team may get up to -25%p for project scores if there is a serious problem with teamwork.** That means, the project grade could be 25/50, even if all presentation and report scores are perfect. This can apply to an individual student, rather than the entire team.


## Deliverables
**All project team members should present an important part in the presentation (speak for at least one minute each)**. You should record your presentation with the **slide and your face**, and upload the video to **YouTube/OpenReview(TBD)**. We recommend you to use [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) (or [Loom](https://www.loom.com/)) for recording. The detailed instruction will be noticed later.
- **Proposal presentation**: 5-8 minute presentation
- **Progress presentation**: 7-10 minute presentation
- **Final presentation**: 10-15 minute presentation
- **Final report**: 4-6 pages report (+ unlimited references) and slides used for final presentation
- **Peer grading**: <s>5</s> 4 peer gradings for proposal, progress, final presentation, <s>slides,</s> and final report
- **Teamwork report**: (individually written/submitted) description of what each team member did

## Venue
**Choose a topic and at least 3 papers** published at the following conferences from **2017**. Among these three papers, choose one as your replication paper, and the others as comparison papers.
- Machine learning conferences: **NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, IJCAI, AAAI**
- NLP/Computer vision conferences: **ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, ICCV, CVPR**
- Data mining conferences: **KDD, CIKM, WSDM**
- AI fairness conferences: **FAccT(FAT)**

## Project Proposal
Give a **5-8 minute proposal presentation** that includes the following:
- **Problem**: What is the topic of your paper? What is the specific task being tackled? Why is it important to solve this problem?
- **Related work**: What existing papers have dealt with this problem? What were their approaches? Discuss the three papers youâ€™ve chosen here.
- **Replication approach**: Which paper will you use for replication and why?
- **Improvement approach**: How will you improve upon the replication paper?
- **Data**: Describe the dataset you will use, even if it is the same one as in the replication paper. If the replication paper does not work with openly available data, explain how you will gather your own data. If using openly available data but you will work with a subset of the data, explain why and how you will select the subset.
- **Plan**: Explain a week-by-week plan of completing this project, clearly indicating which tasks will be done by which team member, and which tasks will be done together.


## Progress Update
Give a **7-10 minute progress presentation** that includes the following:
- **Introduction**: Please briefly explain your problem, approach, and dataset.
- **Replication results**:
  - How did you replicate the original paper? What problems did you face during the replication, and how did you solve them?
  - Describe the experiment setting, results of baseline implementation, replication of the chosen models and experiments. You may not have complete replication results, in which case just explain the results you have so far and a concrete plan of completing the rest.
- **Plan**:
  - Again, how will you improve or modify the original paper? Please have a more concrete plan for this based on the replication results.

## Final Presentation & Final Report
Give a **10-15 minute final presentation** and submit a **4-6 page (+ unlimited references) report** in ICML format. Below is the structure of the final report. The final presentation should contain the same content but in a presentation style.
- **Abstract**: Summary of your work
- **Introduction**: Background and your motivation for the problem
- **Approach**: Your approach to solving the problem
- **Data & Experiments**: Data, model, algorithm, comparisons to baseline models, etc
- **Results**:
  - Replication results
  - Results of your improved approach: use graphs, tables, whatever is most appropriate to present your results
  - Interpretation of results: how do the results answer your research problem?
- **Discussions**: Your improvements and the limitations
- **References** (unlimited pages)

## Peer Grading
- We will probably use OpenReview and/or Google form (TBD)
- Everyone (individually) should grade and comment on
  - x proposal presentations
  - x progress presentations
  - x final presentations & reports

## Teamwork Report
- We will use Google form (TBD)
- Everyone should contribute, and everyone should learn something new
- Everyone (individually) should write
  - Who did what for each task (proposal presentation, progress presentation, project presentation, final report) in detail
  - Any grievances
  - Any praises and special recognitions
  - Due date: same as the final report
